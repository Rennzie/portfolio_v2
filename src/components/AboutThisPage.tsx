        This page is a way for me to show the work that I have been involved over the last year. It
        is also an opportunity for me to play with technologies that I donâ€™t use often in my day to
        day work. While this page is built with React (my go to UI library), I experimented with CSS
        Grid and CSSinJS. I particularly enjoyed making my own theme with the React-JSS package from
        CSSinJS. The app is deployed to Github pages with the gh-pages package. Have a look at the
        repo here.
