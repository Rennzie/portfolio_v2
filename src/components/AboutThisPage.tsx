          This page is a way for me to show the work that I have been involved in over the last
          year. It is also an opportunity for me to play with technologies that I donâ€™t use all that
          often. While this page is built with React (my go to UI library), I experimented with CSS
          Grid, state machines and JSS.

          At a very low level I've tried to use the Material grid specification to build my own grid
          components using css-grid. I also tried out using state machines from XState.js. The
          machine controlls which page is being viewed without the need for a router. Adimitedly its
          a complete over engineering, and using booleans with useState would have been fine. That
          being said, I was just having fun and I'm looking forward to using state machines in my
          other projects.{' '}

          I particularly enjoyed making my own theme with the React-JSS package from CSSinJS. The
          app is deployed to Github pages with the gh-pages package. Have a look at the repo here.
